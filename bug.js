```javascript
// Assuming you have a MongoDB collection named 'users'

db.users.aggregate([
  {
    $match: { age: { $gt: 25 } }
  },
  {
    $group: {
      _id: "$city",
      averageAge: { $avg: "$age" }
    }
  }
]);
```
This aggregation pipeline attempts to calculate the average age for users older than 25, grouped by city.  However, it can fail if the 'age' field is sometimes missing, or contains non-numeric values resulting in an error like:

`Error: argument must be a number`
